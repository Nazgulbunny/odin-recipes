    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna (plural “lasagne”) is a flat and expanded pasta sheet, traditionally made in Italy with Parmigiano-Reggiano (Parmesan cheese), Béchamel sauce (white sauce), and ragù (a meat-based sauce). The dish is made by stacking lasagna sheets on top of each other with meats, vegetables, cheeses, and tomato sauce between. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1pound lean ground beef</li>

        <li>1 (28 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package cottage cheese</li>
        <li>1 pint part-skim ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>8 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese</li>

        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
